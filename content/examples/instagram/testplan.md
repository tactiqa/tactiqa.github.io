# Software Test Plan: Instagram

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Instagram's robust, multi-layered architecture. The primary goal is to validate the platform's capacity to support **2.4 billion users** and handle **140 billion daily Reels plays** while maintaining **99.99% uptime**, exceptional performance, and stringent security. This plan is specifically tailored to Instagram’s unique technology stack, including React Native mobile applications, Django-based microservices, and sophisticated AI-driven recommendation engines.

## 2. Test Scope
This section defines the features and functionalities that are included and excluded from the testing process.

### Features to Test
- **Frontend**: Mobile applications (iOS/Android), and the web interface (covering the feed, user profiles, and the explore tab).
- **Backend**: Core services including user authentication, direct messaging, push notifications, and media processing pipelines.
- **Data Storage**: Validation of databases such as PostgreSQL for user profiles, Cassandra for activity logs, and Redis for caching.
- **Content Delivery**: Testing media uploads and downloads via Amazon S3 and global content distribution through AWS CloudFront.
- **AI Features**: Verification of the Reels recommendation algorithm and content moderation systems.
- **Integrations**: Ensuring seamless cross-posting functionality with other Meta platforms like Facebook.

### Out of Scope
- Testing of third-party client applications that utilize Instagram's APIs.
- Hardware-level testing of physical data centers.

## 3. Test Objectives
- **Functional**: Ensure all features, such as posting, liking, commenting, and live streaming, operate as expected.
- **Performance**: Verify sub-second application load times and confirm scalability to handle peak loads, including the 140 billion daily Reels plays.
- **Security**: Confirm robust data encryption (SSL/TLS), secure authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0), and full compliance with regulations like GDPR and COPPA.
- **Usability**: Validate that the user interface is intuitive and accessible for a diverse global user base.
- **Compatibility**: Guarantee a consistent and seamless user experience across modern versions of iOS, Android, and major web browsers.
- **Localization**: Ensure proper support for multiple languages and regional settings.

## 4. Test Strategy
Our strategy employs a multi-level testing approach to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Testing Levels & Flow
Testing will proceed through distinct levels, from individual components to the system as a whole.

1. **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual microservices (e.g., authentication service) and React Native components.
2. **Integration Testing**: Tests the interactions between services, such as GraphQL API calls and database-to-CDN integrations.
3. **System Testing**: Involves end-to-end testing of complete user flows, like posting a new Reel.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Validates the system against user requirements and business needs, such as the relevance of real-time recommendations.

**_Figure 3:_** _A flowchart illustrating the progression of testing from unit tests to final user acceptance testing._

### Testing Methods
- **Manual Testing**: Used for usability, accessibility, and exploratory testing to uncover issues that automated scripts might miss.
- **Automated Testing**: The cornerstone of our strategy, used for regression, performance, and security testing to ensure consistency and efficiency.

## 5. Test Environment
A dedicated, scalable test environment is crucial for accurate and reliable results.

### Test Environment Architecture
The test environment will be a scaled-down, containerized replica of the production environment, leveraging Docker and Kubernetes for service management. It will utilize key AWS services, including S3 for storage and CloudFront for content delivery, to simulate real-world conditions.

**_Figure 4:_** _The architecture of the test environment, which mirrors the production setup using Kubernetes and AWS services._

- **Hardware**: Cloud-based virtual machines (VMs) configured to match the specifications of production servers.
- **Test Data**: A combination of synthetically generated datasets that mimic 2.4 billion users and anonymized production data will be used to ensure realism in testing scenarios.

## 6. Test Cases
| **Category** | **Test Case ID** | **Description** | **Expected Result** |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Functional** | TC-FUNC-001 | User uploads a photo. | The photo appears in their followers' feeds within 1 second. |
| **Functional** | TC-FUNC-002 | A user starts a live stream. | Viewers can join the stream and post comments in real-time. |
| **Functional** | TC-FUNC-003 | User watches several Reels. | The recommendation engine suggests relevant content based on viewing history. |
| **Performance** | TC-PERF-001 | Simulate 10 million concurrent users accessing the feed. | The feed loads in under 500ms for all users. |
| **Performance** | TC-PERF-002 | User uploads a 1-minute video. | Video transcoding completes within 5 seconds. |
| **Security** | TC-SEC-001 | Attempt to access user data with an invalid OAuth 2.0 token. | Access is denied, and an appropriate error is logged. |
| **Security** | TC-SEC-002 | Monitor media uploads. | All uploads use pre-signed S3 URLs and are encrypted via HTTPS. |

## 7. Test Execution Schedule
Testing activities are aligned with Instagram's continuous deployment model, which involves 30–50 daily pushes. Automated tests are triggered on every code commit, while manual and exploratory testing sessions are conducted bi-weekly.

**_Figure 5:_** _A Gantt chart visualizing the test execution schedule over a four-week sprint cycle._

## 8. Testing Types
- **Performance Testing**: Includes load testing for the main feed, stress testing for Reels playback, and endurance testing with 24-hour runs to detect memory leaks.
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive penetration testing and vulnerability scanning using tools aligned with the OWASP Top 10.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Executed on a matrix of devices and browsers, including iOS 15+, Android 11+, and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Localization Testing**: Verification of UI rendering and functionality for languages such as Arabic, Japanese, and Hindi.
- **AI Testing**: Focuses on validating recommendation accuracy (targeting 90%+ relevance) and the precision of content moderation algorithms.
