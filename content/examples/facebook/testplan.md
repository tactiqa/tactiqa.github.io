## Software Test Plan: Facebook Web Application

---

### 1. Introduction  
This test plan addresses Facebook's web platform, serving **3 billion monthly active users** with features like News Feed, Groups, Marketplace, and Live Streaming. The goal is to validate scalability for **500K concurrent live streams**, **99.99% uptime**, and end-to-end security. The plan covers Facebook's unique tech stack: React frontend, GraphQL APIs, HHVM-based backend, and AI-driven content systems.

**_Figure 1:_** *Facebook’s architecture flow: User requests → CDN (Fastly) → Load balancers → Backend services (HHVM) → TAO data layer → MySQL/Cassandra databases.*

---

### 2. Test Scope  
**Features to Test**  
- **Frontend**: News Feed, Groups, Events, Marketplace, Watch, and Stories  
- **Backend**: GraphQL API, real-time notifications, ad delivery engine, media transcoding  
- **Data Storage**: TAO caching layer, MySQL sharded clusters, ZippyDB (key-value store)  
- **Integrations**: Meta Business Suite, Instagram cross-posting, WhatsApp sharing  
- **AI Systems**: Content ranking algorithms, hate speech detection  

**Out of Scope**  
- Facebook’s internal admin tools  
- Oculus VR platform integrations  

**_Figure 2:_** *UML Use Case diagram: Key actions include "Post Status Update," "Join Group," "Start Live Stream," and "List Marketplace Item."*

### 3. Test Objectives  
- **Functional**: Verify core features (e.g., commenting, event creation, ad bidding)  
- **Performance**: Ensure <1s News Feed load time at 1M+ RPM  
- **Security**: Validate GDPR compliance, OAuth 2.0 flows, and XSS prevention  
- **Usability**: Confirm WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility across all components  
- **Compatibility**: Support Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 3 versions)  
- **Localization**: Test 100+ languages, right-to-left (RTL) layouts  

---

### 4. Test Strategy  
**Testing Levels**  
1. **Unit Testing**: React components, HHVM services  
2. **Integration Testing**: GraphQL resolvers ↔ TAO layer, CDN ↔ media uploads  
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end user journeys (e.g., creating an Event with 10K invites)  
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Business logic validation (e.g., ad targeting accuracy)  

**Testing Methods**  
- **Automated**: 85% coverage via Selenium/Jest for regression  
- **Manual**: Exploratory testing for UX, accessibility

### 5. Test Environment  
**Infrastructure**  
- **Cloud**: Facebook data centers (simulated via Kubernetes clusters)  
- **CDN**: Fastly configuration mirroring production  
- **Data**: Synthetic datasets for 3B user profiles, anonymized ad interaction logs
